This project involves Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on the ground in dense and unstructured forest environments.

**Student(s):** Alexander Wall√©n Kiessling

**Examiner(s):** Patric Jensfelt

# Purpose and Tasks

The main goals of the course are threefold: 
1. Gather datasets of forests to be used for SLAM
2. Procure a SLAM algorithm which is suitable for forest environments
3. Evaluate the solution
