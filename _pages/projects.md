I've worked on quite a few projects, both for research and for personal development. While my more research oriented projects are in the front page, I will try to list some of the projects I've done on my own for fun and learning here.

## Numerical analysis and Linear algebra: Project 1 (19/05/24)
This is the first project of (hopefully) many, and is intended as a refresher and motivation to re-read some coursework on LA and Numerical methods. It will be based on the GTx courses on linear algebra, and the Pearson book on Numerical analysis.
