Hi! My name is Alexander Wall√©n Kiessling, and I work and study in the field of robotics. I like working on topics that (broadly speaking) involve autonomous robotics. This includes environmental monitoring, field robotics, multi-robot systems and machine learning, amongst others.

I've studied my undergraduate degrees in mechanical engineering and physics at KTH in Sweden, where I also worked as a research engineer at the department of [Robotics, Perception and Learning](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl). Currently I am working on robotics at EPFL in Switzerland, at the [Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disal/).
