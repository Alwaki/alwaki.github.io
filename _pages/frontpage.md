My name is Alexander Wall√©n Kiessling, and I am a research engineer at the department of [Robotics, Perception and Learning](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl), KTH Stockholm (see more details in the about me section). I am currently working with Prof. Patric Jensfelt as a PI in projects related to drones, SLAM and forestry automation. I am deeply passionate about autonomy in field robotics, and find the challenge of robots navigating, percieving and acting in difficult environments to be a formidable but rewarding topic. 

This is a template and some instructions for running Github Pages with the [`minima` theme][minima]. This repo has what I consider the minimum pieces for a personal blog using [Jekyll][jk] and [Github Pages][gh-site].

Check out the excellent [`minima` theme][minima] documentation for further details and customization and the [official docs][gh] for more details on how Github Pages work.

Do you have questions? feel free to [open an issue][issue] or find out how toreach me from my [contact page][contact].

Have a great day!!
