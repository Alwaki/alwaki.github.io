title: Book Recommendations
---

I've always enjoyed reading books. As such I've read quite a lot. Here are some of my recommendations for books, both in terms of engineering content and enjoyment. First off is educational content:


- Numerical Analysis, Pearson
    * Contains most things you need to know for numerical methods, and ties it in with linear algebra and calculus. Lacks a bit in optimization, but that is not the main intent of the book.
- Probabilistic Robotics, Thrun
    * An excellent book for the basics in mobile robotics.


Followed by a few sample books in sci/fi. However, I will not recommend the lord of the rings for reading, no matter how much I enjoy the surrounding lore. 

- The name of the wind, Rothfuss. 10/10.
- The wheel of time, Jordan. 8/10.
- Mistborn, Sanderson. 8/10.
- The Lies of Locke Lamora, Lynch. 10/10.
- Magician, Feist. 9/10.
- The hitch-hikers guide to the galaxy, Adams. 8/10.
- Ender's game, Scott. 7/10.
